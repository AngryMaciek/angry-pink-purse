### De-de-noiser
Numerous times one needs to prepare a test dataset while developing a package. However, sometimes it is forbidden to upload the _real_ data to the public, the test dataset needs to be modified significantly. Here is a simple Python function which accepts a 2D data table and returns it with randomly shuffled values.

Requirements: random, numpy, pandas
